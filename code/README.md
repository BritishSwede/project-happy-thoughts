# Happy Thoughts App
Created an app using React hooks, both State and Effect. You can write a happy thought in the form, submit it to the API, and then like other peoples posts. 

## The problem
I had some trouble with making the form look good in mobile version, especially after adding the error message. After trying different approaches I added a width to the character counter, which solved the issue.
