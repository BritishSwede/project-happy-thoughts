# Happy Thoughts

I created a Happy thoughts app, in which you can add and like posts.
The project was made with React.

## The problem

I started by fetching information from Technigo's Happy Thought API. I used React.js with the useState, and useEffect hooks. I also followed the design created by Technigo.

20220108 I changed the API to one created by me.
